# StreetViewHaiku

Ever wanted to have the google street view image for your own?  Now you can.  You can find images based one Lat/Lon, or search terms.  Don't be surprised if you get bored.  Read on.

## Heroku

There is a [live version](http://streetviewhaiku.herokuapp.com) running on heroku.

## Nimble

There is a fine line between self-awareness and self-consciousness.  In large corporations 'scar tissue' is when you've built up so many unnecessary systems/people/processes/rules that once you move forward, you can't go back.  Even if you realize later that mistakes have been made.  I worked on a $50M project at about step 8 when we realized that steps 2, 3, and 4 were badly executed.  At a large enterprise, it's impossible at that point to "un-spend" the customer's money and "re-spend" the money doing it right.

So when I had the idea for this project, it seemed really cool.  After I started to build it, I realized it's ~~not going to make me famous~~ stupid.  So I have the good pleasure of being able to say I haven't spent millions of dollars or hundreds of hours making this.  Don't hold my feet to the fire too badly.
